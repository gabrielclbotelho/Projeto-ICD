# Projeto de Introdução A Ciência de Dados 
Codigo base para trabalhar com projeto de ICD para gerar graficos, correlações e outros


This program loads the german credit dataset as an ARFF file and/or a CSV file from my computer files.
It also plots the data from the from the german credit dataset from weka. It separates categorical from numeric data 
and plots both. This code also generates a statistical summary of the attributes as well as a linear correlation matrix
using pearson's R coefficient and saves both in txt files. At last, it prints a list of atributes and their unique values for the
categorical data and the names of the numerical data as well as summary data saves in an excel file (as a sub function as it
was originally an easy fix for a problem latex fixed the right way).
